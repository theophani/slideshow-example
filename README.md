#Slideshow Example

Each incrementally numbered branch shows progress towards building a slideshow from scratch.

The purpose of this example is to introduce the following concepts:

* HTML as a representation of content
* CSS as a means of defining appearance of the content
* using the web inspector to alter CSS
* using JS to change the style of HTML elements
* adding event listeners to the document

This example could be extended to illustrate:
* using JS to create HTML elements within the document
  (building the slideshow from an array of src paths)
* adding event listeners to elements
  (clicking on navigation, rather than using arrow keys)
* the power of CSS to alter appearance
* how a library such as jQuery could be used
* how a plug-in could replace this code

## TO DO

* Write the accompanying text for each stage (Goal, Step, Explanation)
* Generate an HTML version of the tutorial
